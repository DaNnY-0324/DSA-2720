Instructions: Please complete the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. After you have
finished, scan your work and upload it to Homework Assignment 3 in our Gradescope for the CSC 2720
DATA STRUCTURES XLS Group ACS11 Spring Semester 2025 course.
1. Suppose that x and y are references to nodes of circularly linked lists, although not necessarily the
same list. Describe a fast algorithm for telling if x and y belong to the same list.
2. Describe in detail how to swap two nodes x and y (and not just their contents) in a singly linked
list L given references only to x and y. Repeat this exercise for the case when L is a doubly linked
list. Which algorithm takes more time?
3. Describe, in pseudo-code, an algorithm for computing the number of descendants of each node of
a binary tree. The algorithm should be based on the Euler tour traversal.
