Summary of Queue Implementations Report
This report compares two queue implementations: Singly Linked List-based Queue and Python List-based Queue.

Singly Linked List Queue:

Efficient with O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations.
Uses extra memory for pointers but avoids list resizing overhead.
Best for large-scale operations with frequent insertions and deletions.

Python List Queue:

Simple to implement using append() and pop(0).
Dequeue is O(n) due to shifting elements, making it inefficient for large data.
Best for small-scale applications where ease of use is preferred.

Conclusion:
Use a Linked List Queue for better performance in frequent insertions/deletions.
Use a Python List Queue for quick, simple implementations with minimal operations.
Both implementations correctly demonstrate queue operations and handle queue underflow.
